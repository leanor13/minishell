Notes (29.05) while checking on 42evals:
1. Checking the exit status, sometimes -1 instead of 1, export spaces, export "" ? $ with special symbols
thuy-ngu@c1r9s1:~/minishellfinal$ echo "okay
> 
bash: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
bash: syntax error: unexpected end of file
thuy-ngu@c1r9s1:~/minishellfinal$ echo $?

echo '$USER;;;'
echo '$USERkoevkfvpojrvs'

return(EXIT_FAILURE)

1. OK Pressing tab few times shows all files - ASK FOR EXPLANATION
2. (need to implement) Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls, or any other command with arguments but without any quotes and double quotes. Then execute echo $?
handle $, echo $?, expr $? + $?
Notes: - PARSER: can take *shell as an input. And $? should be shell->exit_status.
      -  PARSER: It would be good if PARSER also can write list right into shell->args_list.
      - EXECUTOR: make sure to write all needed exit statuses to shell->exit_status. Check builtins and cases when no path etc.
For export return error status for {export name = dmkdm}
3. Signals - will do in the end. Don't forget to add signals to here_doc as well
4. PARSER: echo '$USER' - EXPECTED: $USER. NOW it prints content of $USER with ' in the end. echo '"$USER"' should print "$USER", echo "$USER" should print username, now both work good.
5. PARSER: We need to run more tests for single quotes. Also for '$?', some flags etc.
6. (YULIA?) (minor) export should print alphabetically. We can do it if we want.
7. (YULIA - implement cd) , cd and pwd not yet tested. (for pwd testing we need cd). When cd is done, check how it works with empty env (env -i ./minishell)
8. (TINA) export (only need to fix update and case with spaces)
9. (minor) if we do both > and >> redirections, we always do what command->append says. What we can do: not sure... maybe have few lists files_to_append and files_to_rewrite. And put the flag whichever is last.
9. (TINA?)(minor) export $okay=something - in bash this gives error
10. (YULIA) remove all TODO
11. (TINA) ask seombody what it means on EVALUATION SHEET: Check if multiple tries of the same redirections fail.
12. (YULIA) HEREDOC: once SIGNALS done - add signals there
13. (YULIA) ./minishell
14. (TINA?) (minor) cat << f <<
expected behavior
> f
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
15. Memory leaks

3. check all buildins to make sure 1st argument is taken

5. check empty and corrupted env
